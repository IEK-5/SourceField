# the file DV.dat will contain the potentials corrseponding to a 1A current of the corners opposite to the contacts. 
# According to the van der Pauw method the potential difference, DV, should be:
#       Rsq    
# DV =  ---ln(2) = 0.2206356 
#       pi      
# meaning the potentials should be +/- 0.1103178
# DV.dat generated with Sourcefield V0.6:
# 
# We got at least two potentials right....
