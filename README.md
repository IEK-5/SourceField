SourceField: Compute potentials in isolated rectangular lamina

This program can compute the potential within a ractangular conductiove plane 
with isolated edges and two circular contacts (one current injecting source 
and one current extracting sink). The program uses image charges to compute 
the potentials. It can be used to evaluate 4-point measurements (or two 
point if for some reason you prefer that). 

Code will be uploaded soon.
