               Sets the current output file-name. 
               A file-name needs to be specified
               for the following commands:
               contact_coord, source_coord, field,
               potential, and fieldline.
nangle                                             Integer      20        -
               Field-lines start at a point on a  
               circle around either a source or
               sink. This parameter sets the

               equidistant points along the
               circle.

               coordinates of the positive and
               negative contact and their images
               in the area defined with px1, py1,
               px2, and py2. Mostly intended
               checking and debugging purposes.

               defined with px1, py1, px2, and
               py2. The difference with
               contact_coord is that source_coord
               includes the computed offsets of
               sources and sinks w.r.t the centers
               of the contacts. Mostly intended

               with nx and ny.

               Compute the potential in the area  
               defined with px1, py1, px2, and
               py2. The resolution is set with nx
               and ny.

               Compute offsets of the source and  
               sink positions to minimize the 
	       potential variations along the 
	       circumference of the contacts. 
	       Unlike the command offsets, 
	       warp_offsets uses the spatial 
	       transformation with the complex 
	       Jacobi sine amplitude function to 
	       reduce the number of sources and 
	       sinks. Performance and accuracy of 
	       this command, however, tend to be 
	       worse than the offsets command.
	       Without issuing this command the 
	       sources and sinks are positioned 
	       in the contact centers.

               between  the coordinates (px1,py1)
               and (px2,py2), using the closed 
	       form expressions based on a spatial 
	       transformation with the complex 
	       Jacobi sine amplitude function.

	       the closed form expressions based

               Compute the potential using the     
	       closed form expressions based on a 
	       spatial transformation with the 
	       complex Jacobi sine amplitude 
	       function. The potentials are 
	       computed in the area defined with 
	       px1, py1, px2, and py2. The 
	       resolution is set with nx and ny.

	       expressions.

	       along the circumference of the 
	       contacts. Without issuing this 
	       command the sources and sinks are 
	       positioned in the contact centers.
bess_fast                                          None         n.a.      n.a.
               Initialize the bessel calculations
               with fewer sources. This will have

               Compute the electric field using   
               the modified bessel funktion 
	       solution in the area defined with 
	       px1, py1, px2,and py2. The 
	       resolution is set with nx and ny.
bess_potential Compute the potential using the     None         n.a.      n.a.
               modified bessel function solution
	       in the area defined with px1, py1, 
	       px2, and py2. The resolution is 
	       set with nx and ny. 
bess_fieldline Compute field-lines using the       None         n.a.      n.a.
               modified bessel function solution
	       in the area defined with px1, py1, 
	       px2, and py2. The accuracy is 
	       governed by the parameter fl_acc.
fl_acc                                             Numeric      5e-3      -
               Accuracy of the field-line routine.
